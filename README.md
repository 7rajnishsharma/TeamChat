# TeamChat

This website allows users to have video chat, voice chat, chatbox, and screen sharing meetings. It is built using WebRTC, a technology that allows real-time communication between browsers.

I have integrated the [Agora](https://www.agora.io/en/) API on this website, to offer real-time voice, video, and chat capabilities. This integration enables my users to enjoy engaging and interactive experiences.


## Requirements

 - A web browser that supports WebRTC (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera)
 - A microphone and speakers
 - A webcam
