# TeamChat

This website allows users to have video chat, voice chat, chatbox, and screen sharing meetings. It is built using WebRTC, a technology that allows real-time communication between browsers.

I have integrated the [Agora](https://www.agora.io/en/) API on this website, to offer real-time voice, video, and chat capabilities. This integration enables my users to enjoy engaging and interactive experiences.

## Features

•	Video chat: Users can see each other in real time. 

•	Voice chat: Users can talk to each other in real time.

•	Chatbox: Users can send text messages to each other.

•	Screen sharing: Users can share their screens with each other.

## Requirements

 •	A web browser that supports WebRTC (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera)
 
 •	A microphone and speakers
 
 •	A webcam
